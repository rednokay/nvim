# My Neovim Config

Mostly copied from @LukeSmithxyz (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/tree/master/.config/nvim).

## Installation

Obviously, Neovim needs to be installed. Also, install vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for Neovim.

To install used plug-ins, open the init.vim and run :PlugInstall
